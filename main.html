	<p>On the occasion of his fifth wedding anniversary,  
	   Nick Dunne reports that his wife, Amy, has gone missing. 
	   Under pressure from the police and a growing media frenzy, 
	   Nick's portrait of a blissful union begins to crumble. 
       Soon his lies, deceits and strange behavior have everyone asking the same dark question:
		Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?
